# UK-Crime-Analytics

This project presents a comprehensive data engineering and analytics solution for analyzing and predicting crime patterns in the United Kingdom. Using large-scale UK crime datasets (over 65 million entries) hosted on Azure Blob Storage, this project demonstrates data ingestion, cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, and advanced analytical modeling techniques leveraging PySpark and cloud infrastructure.

Key Components and Workflow:

Efficient ingestion of large-scale raw crime and population datasets from Azure Blob Storage into distributed Spark dataframes.

Data cleaning: Handling missing values and filtering relevant crime categories such as violent crime, firearm incidents, and drug offenses.

Feature extraction to identify crime trends, locations, and detailed breakdown of crime types using Spark SQL and DataFrame operations.

Time series analysis of violent crimes over multiple years, including seasonal decomposition, stationarity checks, and trend identification for forecasting.

Advanced machine learning with SARIMA models for predicting future crime rates.

Correlation and regression analysis revealing significant associations between firearm incidents and drug offenses across UK locations.

Visual analytics integrating statistical plots, heatmaps, pie charts, and scatter plots for actionable insights.

Implementation of scalable ETL pipelines, error handling, and data validation techniques leveraging cloud IaaS.

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) with robust visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Use of data engineering best practices for maintainability, auditability, and scalability in a big data context.

Data Engineering Skills Demonstrated:

Big data processing using PySpark on Azure cloud infrastructure with distributed data processing.

ETL pipeline design for ingestion, transformation, and loading of multi-terabyte crime and demographic datasets.

Integration of statistical and machine learning models within scalable data workflows.

Application of time series analysis and model selection for accurate crime prediction.

Handling complex data quality issues and ensuring robust pipeline operations.

Presentation of insights through data visualization and statistical evaluation.

Cloud storage and VM utilization for heavy data workloads.

This project showcases practical expertise for data engineering roles specializing in big data analytics, cloud data infrastructure, and predictive modeling for real-world social datasets.
